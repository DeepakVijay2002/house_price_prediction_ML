# house_price_prediction_ML
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models trained on features such as location, rooms, area, and population. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The best-performing models achieved ~75â€“85% accuracy, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showing strong results. Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates practical applications of ML in real-estate price forecasting.
